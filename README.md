## Overview
My first Front-end Mentor project. The goal was to recreate the design files provided, displaying a QR code linking to the Front-End Mentor site. I created a mobile version and a desktop version with the specified sizes.

## My process
I designed this mobile-first in CSS, which made changes to the desktop version fairly simple. I opted to use Flexbox as it's what I'm most familiar with.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflows

### Continued development

I would like to circle back and do this project with CSS Grid in the future; I want more practice with it.
